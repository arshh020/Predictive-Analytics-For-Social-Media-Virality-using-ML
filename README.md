# Social Media Virality Prediction

## Overview
The **Social Media Virality Prediction** project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the virality of social media content. The system utilizes various factors such as likes, shares, and comments to determine the potential reach and influence of a given post. It also includes functionalities for identifying influential spreaders in online networks.

## Features
- Predicts virality of social media posts based on user engagement metrics.
- Identifies influential spreaders in online networks.
- Uses deep learning models such as RNNs, GNNs, and CNNs for real-time analysis.
- Web-based interface for users to upload content and predict viral potential.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Uvicorn
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or any preferred database)
- **Machine Learning Models:** TensorFlow / PyTorch

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps to Set Up
#### 1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-virality.git
cd social-media-virality
```

#### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Start the backend server:
```sh
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

This command starts the FastAPI backend with automatic reloading during development.

#### 5. Access the API:
Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:
- **API Documentation (Swagger UI):** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- **Redoc UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)
